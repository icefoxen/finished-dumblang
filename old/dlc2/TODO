Things to add (short term):
floating point type
Module system
Making local labels would be nice
None type

(longer term)
Globals/consts
Inline assembly!
Array and pointer types
For loops
elif's


I think that we ARE going to need a None type, something that means "No valid
return type".  Even OCaml has one, unit.  So...
